# Digit-Recognition

## Overview
In this thread, i'm building 3 Classifiers from scratch, for Digit-Recognition:

1. Euclidean-Distance
2. Gaussian-Naive-Bayes
3. MLP-Classifier

I'm comparing the cross-val scores and plot their desicion surfaces, as well as the learning curves.
in additon, for statistical reasons, i'm applying fine-tunning on Voting and Bagging models, to compare with mine. 

In Version 2, i am going to present the mathematical base behind these implementations and observations.

## Execution

In src directory, run:
```
python main.py
```
